name: superplan
description: "Produce higher-quality code by breaking a feature into small, focused tasks the coding agent can nail one at a time. Works like an engineering team: feature → milestones (product deliverables) → ~30-min tasks with specific files, acceptance criteria, and dependencies. Each task runs in a fresh context — narrow scope, full attention, one git commit per task. Use when starting any non-trivial feature, complex refactor, or whenever you want the agent focused on one small thing at a time instead of juggling an entire feature in one session. Supports /loop for autonomous execution."

# SuperPlan Command

When user runs `/superplan` or `/sp`, route to the appropriate subcommand based on the argument.

## Routing

| Argument | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `status` | Show progress across all active plans |
| `next` or `next <plan_file>` | Execute next unchecked task |
| `next --yes` or `next <plan_file> --yes` | Execute next unchecked task without confirmation prompt |
| `next M<N>` or `next M<N> <plan_file>` | Execute all tasks in milestone N without stopping |
| `review` or `review <plan_file>` | Re-evaluate plan against current code state |
| Anything else | Create a new plan (treat argument as feature description or ticket ID) |

---

## Subcommand: Create (Default)

**Trigger:** `/superplan <feature description>` or `/superplan <TICKET-ID>` (or `/sp` as shorthand)

### Steps

#### 1. Gather Context

- If argument looks like a ticket ID or issue tracker URL:
  - Fetch ticket details using whatever issue tracker tools are available (Linear, GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.)
  - Extract title, description, attachments, acceptance criteria
- If argument is a free-text description:
  - Use it as the feature description directly

#### 2. Research the Codebase

Use **parallel Explore agents** to understand what exists:

- **Agent 1:** Search for related code, patterns, and existing implementations
- **Agent 2:** Identify files that will likely need changes
- **Agent 3:** Check for database schema implications, API routes, shared types

Synthesize findings into a clear understanding of what needs to change.

#### 2.5. Define Product Intent

Before breaking work into milestones, articulate the product reasoning:

- **For each potential milestone**, answer: Who benefits from this? What can they do after it ships that they couldn't before? Why this approach over alternatives?
- **For milestones involving user-facing choices** (which examples to build, which defaults to set, which APIs to expose), document the selection criteria and reasoning — not just the final pick.
- **For milestones that are primarily technical** (refactoring, infra, CI), connect them to the user outcome they enable: "Users can't install via pip until we have a publish workflow."

This step prevents the plan from becoming a file-change checklist disconnected from user value. If you can't articulate who benefits from a milestone, it may not belong in the plan — or it should be folded into another milestone that has a clear user outcome.

#### 3. Design the Plan

Break the feature into **milestones** (product deliverables) and **tasks** (developer work items):

**Milestones** are product deliverables, not task groups. Each should read as if a PM wrote it:
- **Independently valuable** — each delivers something a user can see, use, or benefit from
- **Ordered from most foundational to most advanced** — early milestones unblock later ones
- **Testable end-to-end** — not just "code compiles" but "a user can do X"
- **Product-justified** — the description explains *who benefits* and *why this matters*, not just *what gets built*. If a milestone is purely technical (infra, CI, refactoring), connect it to the user outcome it enables.

**Tasks** should be:
- Small enough to complete in one conversation (~30 min of Claude work)
- Written as **instructions for the developer** — describe what needs to happen, expected behavior, and constraints (not step-by-step implementation code)
- Fully working and testable after completion
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- List specific files to create/modify
- Declare dependencies on other tasks

**Deliverable Spec (when applicable):** If this milestone produces a concrete artifact that can be exhaustively listed — CLI commands, API endpoints, UI screens, config keys, data schema — add a **"### Deliverable Spec"** section immediately before the task list. Format by domain:
- **CLI:** `command | required args | optional args | description` table
- **REST API:** `endpoint | method | params | response shape` table
- **UI:** key screens, actions, states
- **Config/schema:** key, type, default, description

For milestones whose output is a code quality improvement (refactor, perf, test coverage, bug fix), skip the table and add a **"### Before/After"** section instead — one or two sentences: "Currently X happens; after this milestone Y happens instead." This is the minimum that makes the deliverable unambiguous.

Every milestone needs either a Deliverable Spec table OR a Before/After statement. Never just narrative.

**Diagrams:** When the feature involves architecture, data flow, or multi-component interactions, include **mermaid diagrams** in the plan (e.g., flowcharts for data flow, sequence diagrams for API interactions, component diagrams for architecture). Add these in a `## Diagrams` section or inline within the relevant milestone.

#### 4. Generate Plan File

- Derive a kebab-case name from the feature (e.g., `user-api-keys`, `slack-integration`)
- Create the file at `plans/<name>.plan.md`

**Use this exact template:**

```markdown
# Plan: <Feature Title>

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | draft |
| Created | <YYYY-MM-DD> |
| Ticket | <ticket ID or N/A> |
| Branch | <branch name or TBD> |

## Context

<2-3 sentences: what we're building, why, and key constraints>

## Architecture Decisions

<Key technical decisions made during planning. Update as implementation progresses.>

- **Decision 1:** <description> — <rationale>

## Diagrams

<Include mermaid diagrams when relevant — architecture, data flow, component interactions, sequences, etc. Omit this section if diagrams aren't helpful for the feature.>

```mermaid
<diagram here>
```

## Milestones Overview

<High-level numbered list of all milestones for quick scanning>

1. **<Milestone 1 Name>** — <one-line description of what it delivers>
2. **<Milestone 2 Name>** — <one-line description of what it delivers>

---

## Milestone 1: <Product Deliverable Name>

**Why this matters:** <Who benefits and what they can do after this ships. Write as if a PM is justifying this to stakeholders — not "add 3 templates" but "developers evaluating Canopy can see immediately how to build agents for their own use cases, reducing time-to-first-agent from hours to minutes.">

**Success criteria:** <Observable user outcome, not just "tests pass." Example: "A developer who has never seen Canopy can `canopy create` from an example template, connect to it, and have a useful conversation within 5 minutes.">

**Key decisions:** <If this milestone involves choices (which templates, which API design, which defaults), state what was chosen and why. This prevents the implementing agent from second-guessing or making different choices.>

### Deliverable Spec

<Include ONE of the following — never omit both:>

<**Option A — Concrete artifact** (CLI commands, API endpoints, UI screens, config schema): a structured table the implementing developer can use as a checklist. Example for a CLI milestone:>
| Command | Required args | Optional args | Description |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| `cx slos list` | — | `--order-by` | List all SLOs |
| `cx slos get <ID>` | `ID` | — | Get SLO details |

<**Option B — Before/After** (refactors, bug fixes, perf, test coverage): one or two sentences that state what changes.>
<Example: "Currently `cx --help` shows 37 commands in a flat alphabetical list. After this milestone it shows commands organized under labeled domain headings.">

### 1.1 [ ] <Task Title>
- **Files:** `path/to/file1`, `path/to/file2`
- **What:** <Instructions for the developer — describe what needs to happen, expected behavior, and any constraints>
- **Acceptance:** <How to verify it works>
- **Dependencies:** None

### 1.2 [ ] <Task Title>
- **Files:** `path/to/file`
- **What:** <Instructions for the developer — describe what needs to happen, expected behavior, and any constraints>
- **Acceptance:** <How to verify>
- **Dependencies:** 1.1

---

## Milestone 2: <Product Deliverable Name>

**Why this matters:** <Who benefits and what changes for them>

**Success criteria:** <Observable user outcome>

**Key decisions:** <Choices made and why>

### 2.1 [ ] <Task Title>
- **Files:** `path/to/file`
- **What:** <Instructions for the developer — describe what needs to happen, expected behavior, and any constraints>
- **Acceptance:** <How to verify>
- **Dependencies:** 1.2

...
```

#### 5. Present to User

Show the user:
- Milestones overview (the high-level list)
- Total task count
- Estimated complexity per milestone
- Ask: "Review and edit `plans/<name>.plan.md`, then run `/plan next` to start executing."

**Do NOT start implementing.** The plan is a draft for user review.

---

## Subcommand: Status

**Trigger:** `/superplan status` or `/sp status`

### Steps

1. Glob for `plans/*.plan.md` files
2. For each plan file, parse:
   - Plan title (from `# Plan:` heading)
   - Status field
   - Count of `[x]` (completed) vs `[ ]` (pending) tasks
   - Current milestone (first milestone with incomplete tasks)
3. Display summary table:

```
## Active Plans

| Plan | Status | Progress | Current Milestone |
|------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| User API Keys | in-progress | 5/12 (42%) | Milestone 2: Key Management UI |
| Slack Integration | draft | 0/8 (0%) | Milestone 1: Webhook Setup |
```

If no plan files found, show: "No plans found. Create one with `/superplan <feature description>` or `/sp <description>`"

---

## Subcommand: Next

**Trigger:** `/superplan next` or `/superplan next plans/<name>.plan.md` (or `/sp` as shorthand) or either with `--yes` flag, or `next M<N>` for milestone mode

### Milestone Mode (`next M<N>`)

When a milestone number is provided (e.g., `next M3` or `next M3 plans/foo.plan.md`):

1. Find the plan (same logic as below)
2. Locate all tasks whose IDs start with `3.` (i.e., belong to Milestone 3)
3. Execute each task in order, **without any confirmation prompt** (milestone mode is always auto-yes)
4. After each task: mark complete, commit, show progress
5. **Stop after the last task in that milestone** — do not continue into the next milestone
6. Show a milestone completion summary:
   ```
   Milestone 3 complete: 4/4 tasks done
   Next milestone: Milestone 4 — <name>
   Run `/sp next M4` to continue.
   ```
7. If some tasks in the milestone are already `[x]`, skip them and only run remaining `[ ]` tasks
8. If all tasks in the milestone are already complete, report that and exit

### Steps

#### 1. Find the Plan

- If plan file specified, use it
- If not specified:
  - Glob for `plans/*.plan.md`
  - If exactly one `in-progress` plan exists, use it
  - If multiple exist, ask the user which one
  - If none exist, show error: "No active plans. Create one with `/superplan <feature description>` or `/sp <description>`"

#### 2. Find Next Task

- Parse the plan file for the first unchecked task (`[ ]`)
- Verify its dependencies are all completed (`[x]`)
- If dependencies are not met, find the next task whose dependencies ARE met
- If no executable task found, report: "All tasks complete!" or "Blocked — remaining tasks have unmet dependencies"

#### 3. Update Plan Status

- If plan status is `draft`, update it to `in-progress`

#### 4. Display Task Context

Show the user:
- Task ID and title (e.g., "Task 2.1: Add API endpoint for key creation")
- Files to modify
- Changes description
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies status

If the `--yes` flag was passed, skip the confirmation prompt and proceed directly to implementation. Otherwise ask: "Ready to implement this task? (y/n)"

#### 5. Implement the Task

After user confirms (or immediately if `--yes` was passed):

1. **Read the full plan** for context (understand what was built before and what comes next)
2. **Implement the changes** described in the task spec
3. **Verify acceptance criteria** — run relevant tests, make API calls, or take screenshots
4. **Run code quality checks** if the project has them (e.g., linting, type checking, tests)
5. **Mark the task complete** — update the plan file:
   - Change `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Add completion timestamp: `[x] <Task Title> *(completed YYYY-MM-DD)*`
6. **Commit the work** with message: `Plan <N.M>: <Task Title>`
   - Include the plan file update in the commit

#### 6. Show Progress

After completing the task, display:
```
Completed: 2.1 - Add API endpoint for key creation
Progress: 6/12 tasks (50%)
Next up: 2.2 - Add key validation middleware
```

---

## Subcommand: Review

**Trigger:** `/superplan review` or `/superplan review plans/<name>.plan.md` (or `/sp review`)

### Steps

#### 1. Find the Plan

Same logic as `next` subcommand for finding the plan file.

#### 2. Analyze Current State

Use parallel agents to:
- **Agent 1:** Read the plan file and understand what was planned vs. completed
- **Agent 2:** Read the actual code changes (git diff from branch base) to understand what was built
- **Agent 3:** Check if remaining tasks are still accurate (files may have moved, APIs changed)

#### 3. Generate Review Report

```
## Plan Review: <Feature Name>

### Progress
- Completed: X/Y tasks
- Current milestone: <name>

### Drift Analysis
<List any discrepancies between plan and reality>
- Task 2.1 specified `users_route.py` but implementation went in `api_keys_route.py`
- New dependency discovered: need migration before task 3.1

### Recommended Changes
- [ ] Update task 2.3 files list (route was renamed)
- [ ] Add new task 2.5 for migration
- [ ] Remove task 3.2 (handled by task 2.1 already)

### Updated Remaining Tasks
<Show the remaining tasks with any suggested modifications>
```

#### 4. Apply Updates

Ask user: "Apply these plan updates? (y/n)"

If yes, update the plan file with corrections.

## Plan File Conventions

- **Location:** Always in `plans/` directory at project root
- **Naming:** `<kebab-case-feature>.plan.md`
- **Status values:** `draft` -> `in-progress` -> `complete`
- **Task format:** `### <N.M> [ ] <Title>` for pending, `### <N.M> [x] <Title> *(completed YYYY-MM-DD)*` for done
- **Gitignore:** Plans are committed to git (useful for team visibility). Add to `.gitignore` only if user prefers.

---

## Integration with Project Workflow

The plan system is designed to work alongside any project's existing workflow:

- `/plan` handles the planning phase for large features
- Individual tasks follow the same implementation patterns as any dev task
- Run project-specific code quality checks after each task implementation
- When all tasks complete, create a PR for the full feature (or per milestone)
- `/plan review` can be run anytime to check plan health

If the project has specific commands for code checks, PR creation, or ticket management, use those as part of task execution.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting implementation before user reviews the plan
- Creating tasks that are too large (>1 hour of work)
- Creating tasks that aren't independently testable
- Skipping acceptance criteria
- Not updating the plan file after completing tasks
- Ignoring dependency ordering
- Creating a plan for a trivial task (just do it directly)
- Writing milestone descriptions that only say what to build, not who benefits or why
- Making user-facing choices (which examples, which defaults, which names) without documenting the reasoning in the milestone
- Writing a milestone with only narrative ("users can manage SLOs") and no Deliverable Spec table or Before/After statement — the developer should never have to infer what concretely ships

## Good Practices

- Keep tasks small and focused (~30 min each)
- Make each task independently verifiable
- Update architecture decisions as you learn things during implementation
- Commit after each task (not after each milestone)
- Review the plan periodically with `/plan review`
- Edit the plan file directly when scope changes
- Write milestone descriptions as if a PM is justifying them — who benefits, what changes for the user
- Document the "why" behind choices so the implementing agent doesn't second-guess them
- Every milestone has a Deliverable Spec table (for features with enumerable artifacts) OR a Before/After statement (for refactors/fixes) — pick whichever fits, never omit both
