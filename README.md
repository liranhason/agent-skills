# HSN Claude Configuration

Claude Code configuration — `/plan` command, `/ask` command, and plan execution skill.

## Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/git/hsn-claude
ln -s ~/git/hsn-claude/commands ~/.claude/commands
ln -s ~/git/hsn-claude/skills ~/.claude/skills
```

## `/plan` — Structured Agentic Development

`/plan` breaks large features into milestones and tasks, tracks progress in a markdown file, and executes each task with acceptance criteria and an automatic commit. Pair it with `/loop` and Claude works through an entire feature autonomously while you do something else.

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan <description>` | Research the codebase and generate a structured plan file |
| `/plan <TICKET-ID>` | Same, but fetches ticket details from Linear/GitHub/Jira first |
| `/plan next` | Execute the next unchecked task (asks for confirmation) |
| `/plan next --yes` | Execute the next task without confirmation |
| `/plan next plans/foo.plan.md` | Target a specific plan file |
| `/plan status` | Show progress across all active plans |
| `/plan review` | Re-evaluate the plan against current code state |

**Typical workflow:**

```bash
/plan Add JWT authentication        # 1. Claude researches codebase, writes plans/jwt-auth.plan.md
# Review and edit the plan file
/plan next                          # 2. Execute task 1.1, commit, mark done
/plan next                          # 3. Execute task 1.2, commit, mark done
# ...or use /loop to run all tasks automatically (see below)
```

### vs. Ralph Loop

Ralph Wiggum is a popular Claude Code technique: a Stop hook blocks Claude's session exit and re-feeds the same prompt, looping until Claude outputs a completion string. It's zero-setup and works well for unbounded tasks.

`/loop /plan next --yes` is a **structured Ralph loop** — same autonomous iteration, but each loop executes a named task with explicit acceptance criteria and makes a git commit before advancing.

| | Ralph Loop | `/loop /plan next --yes` |
|--|--|--|
| **Structure** | Unstructured — same prompt re-fed each iteration | Structured — next `[ ]` task with files, deps, acceptance criteria |
| **Progress tracking** | None | `[x]` checkboxes + completion timestamps in plan file |
| **Completion signal** | String match (e.g. `"DONE"`) or `--max-iterations` | "All tasks complete!" when no `[ ]` remain |
| **Commits** | None | One commit per task: `Plan 2.1: <title>` |
| **Dependency ordering** | None | Won't run a task until its deps are `[x]` |
| **Resumability** | Restart from scratch if interrupted | Stop and resume anywhere — progress persists in the plan file |
| **Loop mechanism** | Stop hook (inside session) | `/loop` skill (new prompt each iteration) |

**Bottom line:** Ralph wins on zero-setup for exploratory tasks. `/plan` + `/loop` wins on auditability, resumability, and correctness — you get a full git history and can always inspect exactly which task failed and why.

### Auto-executing with `/loop`

#### Example 1: Run an entire plan unattended

You've reviewed the plan and it looks good. Let Claude execute every task while you take a break.

```bash
/loop /plan next --yes plans/dark-mode.plan.md
```

What happens:
1. Finds task 1.1, reads full plan for context, implements, runs tests, commits `Plan 1.1: Define CSS variable palettes`
2. Marks `[ ]` → `[x]`, finds task 2.1
3. Implements, commits `Plan 2.1: Add theme toggle to settings panel`
4. No more tasks → prints "All tasks complete!" and the loop stops

#### Example 2: Run only the first milestone, then review

If you want a human checkpoint between milestones, just interrupt after milestone 1 completes and inspect before resuming.

```bash
/loop /plan next --yes plans/jwt-auth.plan.md
# Watch output — when milestone 1 tasks are all done, press Ctrl+C
# Review the code, test it, adjust the plan if needed
/loop /plan next --yes plans/jwt-auth.plan.md   # resume milestone 2
```

Each task was committed separately, so `git log` shows clean progress and any milestone is easy to roll back.

#### Example 3: Resume a plan that's already in-progress

The plan is 40% done from a previous session. Pick up exactly where you left off:

```bash
/plan status                        # see which tasks are done and what's next
/loop /plan next --yes              # auto-detects the in-progress plan, resumes from first [ ]
```

Claude re-reads the full plan on each iteration — completed tasks give it context about what was already built, future tasks show what constraints to keep in mind.

### Safety

- Review the plan file before looping — it's plain markdown, easy to edit
- `--yes` skips confirmation prompts; omit it to approve each task manually
- Each task commits separately — easy to `git revert` a single bad task without losing everything
- Cancel anytime with `Ctrl+C`; the plan file preserves progress so the next `/plan next` picks up where you left off

## Plan File Format

Plans live in `plans/*.plan.md` in your **project repo** (not this config repo). The `/plan` command creates and manages them.

### Anatomy of a Plan File

```markdown
# Plan: <Title>

| Field   | Value        |
|---------|--------------|
| Status  | draft        |   ← draft | in-progress | complete
| Created | 2026-04-10   |
| Ticket  | ENG-123      |   ← or N/A
| Branch  | feature/foo  |   ← or TBD

## Context
Why this work exists — the problem, the constraint, the goal.

## Architecture Decisions
Key choices made upfront so implementers don't re-litigate them mid-task.

## Diagrams (optional)
Mermaid flowcharts or sequence diagrams.

## Milestones Overview
Numbered list of major phases.

---

## Milestone 1: <Name>

### 1.1 [ ] Task title

- **Files:** path/to/file.py, path/to/other.py
- **What:** Step-by-step instructions for the implementer.
- **Acceptance:** How to verify this task is done (command to run, behavior to observe).
- **Dependencies:** None | 1.1, 2.3

### 1.2 [x] Completed task title *(completed 2026-04-11)*

...

## Verification

End-to-end checklist — commands to run, behaviors to confirm — after all milestones are done.
```

### Task Checkboxes

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Not started |
| `[x]` | Complete (add `*(completed YYYY-MM-DD)*` inline) |

### Example: `/plan status` Output

```
Plan: Add JWT Authentication System
Status: in-progress | Created: 2026-04-10

Progress: 5/14 tasks complete (36%)

Milestones
✓ 1. Data Layer (3/3) — COMPLETE
  ✓ 1.1 Add User model with hashed password field
  ✓ 1.2 Add password hashing utilities
  ✓ 1.3 Add JWT creation and validation utilities

✓ 2. Auth Endpoints (2/3) — IN PROGRESS
  ✓ 2.1 Implement POST /api/auth/register
  ✓ 2.2 Implement POST /api/auth/login
  ◯ 2.3 Implement POST /api/auth/refresh and logout

◯ 3. Route Protection (0/2)
◯ 4. Frontend Integration (0/2)

Next task: 2.3 Implement POST /api/auth/refresh and logout
Files: src/routers/auth.py
Dependencies: 2.2
```

### Why This Format Is Powerful

1. **Resumability** — Stop mid-task, come back weeks later, pick up exactly where you left off.
2. **Parallelism** — Dependencies are explicit. Tasks with no deps can run concurrently across people or agents.
3. **Auditability** — Every architectural decision is documented with the reasoning. Future maintainers understand *why*, not just *what*.
4. **Incremental progress** — A 50-task feature becomes 50 small, testable units. Each one verifiable before the next starts.

### Example Plans

See `plans/examples/` in this repo for annotated examples:

| Example | Complexity | What it shows |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| [`add-feature.plan.md`](./plans/examples/add-feature.plan.md) | 2 milestones, 2 tasks | Minimal structure for a simple UI feature |
| [`api-refactor.plan.md`](./plans/examples/api-refactor.plan.md) | 3 milestones, 5 tasks | Dependency tracking, flowchart diagram, incremental migration |
| [`auth-system.plan.md`](./plans/examples/auth-system.plan.md) | 4 milestones, 9 tasks | Full-stack feature with parallel milestone tracks |

## `/ask` Command

Read-only Q&A mode — Claude answers questions without modifying any files. Useful for understanding code, architecture, or investigating before making changes.

```bash
/ask How does the auth system work?
/ask What's the difference between X and Y?
```
